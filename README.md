The idea of a design pattern is an attempt to standardize what are already accepted best practices.

Creational :
These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. 
While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, 
object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

Structural :
These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

Behavioral :
